          <h2>1. Use of the Services and Axiom Properties</h2>The Website, the Services, the
          Software (defined in Section 1.1 below), and the information and content available on or
          through the Website, the Software, and the Services (as these terms are defined herein)
          (each, a “Axiom Property” and collectively, the “Axiom Properties”) are protected by
          copyright laws throughout the world. Subject to the Agreement, Axiom grants you a limited
          license to reproduce portions of Axiom Properties for the sole purpose of using the
          Services for your personal or internal business purposes. Unless otherwise specified by
          Axiom in a separate license, your right to use any and all Axiom Properties is subject to
          the Agreement.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>1.1 Axiom Software.</b> Use of any software and associated documentation that is
              made available via the Website or the Services (“Software”) is governed by the terms
              of the license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Software, or by the
              license agreement expressly stated on the Website page(s) accompanying the Software.
              These license terms may be posted with the Software downloads or at the Website page
              where the Software can be accessed. You shall not use, download or install any
              Software that is accompanied by or includes a license agreement unless you agree to
              the terms of such license agreement. At no time will Axiom provide you with any
              tangible copy of our Software. Axiom shall deliver access to the Software via
              electronic transfer or download and shall not use or deliver any tangible media in
              connection with the (a) delivery, installation, updating or problem resolution of any
              Software (including any new releases); or (b) delivery, correction or updating of
              documentation. For the purposes of this section tangible media shall include, but not
              be limited to, any tape disk, compact disk, card, flash drive, or any other comparable
              physical medium. Unless the accompanying license agreement expressly allows otherwise,
              any copying or redistribution of the Software is prohibited, including any copying or
              redistribution of the Software to any other server or location, or redistribution or
              use on a service bureau basis. If there is any conflict between the Agreement and the
              license agreement, the license agreement shall take precedence in relation to that
              Software (except as provided in the following sentence). If the Software is a
              pre-release version, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary included within an
              accompanying license agreement, you are not permitted to use or otherwise rely on the
              Software for any commercial or production purposes. If no license agreement
              accompanies use of the Software, use of the Software will be governed by the
              Agreement. Subject to your compliance with the Agreement, Axiom grants you a
              non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable non-exclusive license
              to use the Software for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Services in the
              manner permitted by the Agreement. Some Software may be offered under an open source
              license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source
              license that expressly override some of these terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1.2 Updates.</b> You understand that Axiom Properties are evolving. As a result,
              Axiom may require you to accept updates to Axiom Properties that you have installed on
              your computer or mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that Axiom may update Axiom
              Properties with or without notifying you. You may need to update third-party software
              from time to time in order to use Axiom Properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1.3 Certain Restrictions.</b> The rights granted to you in the Agreement are
              subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease,
              transfer, assign, reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit Axiom
              Properties or any portion of Axiom Properties, including the Website; (b) you shall
              not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other Axiom
              Properties (including images, text, page layout or form) of Axiom; (c) you shall not
              use any metatags or other “hidden text” using Axiom&apos;s name or trademarks; (d) you
              shall not modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble,
              decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of Axiom Properties except to
              the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (e)
              you shall not use any manual or automated software, devices or other processes
              (including but not limited to spiders, robots, scrapers, crawlers, avatars, data
              mining tools or the like) to “scrape” or download data from any web pages contained in
              the Website (except that we grant the operators of public search engines revocable
              permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Website for the sole purpose of
              and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices
              of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (f) you shall not
              access Axiom Properties in order to build a similar or competitive website,
              application or service; (g) except as expressly stated herein, no part of Axiom
              Properties may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed,
              posted or transmitted in any form or by any means; and (h) you shall not remove or
              destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in Axiom
              Properties. Any future release, update or other addition to Axiom Properties shall be
              subject to the Agreement. Axiom, its suppliers and service providers reserve all
              rights not granted in the Agreement. Any unauthorized use of any Axiom Property
              terminates the licenses granted by Axiom pursuant to the Agreement. Notwithstanding
              the foregoing, decompiling any portion of Axiom Properties is permitted to the extent
              the laws of your jurisdiction give you the right to do so to obtain information
              necessary to render Axiom Properties interoperable with other software; provided,
              however, that you must first request such information from Axiom and Axiom may, in its
              discretion, either provide such information to you or impose reasonable conditions,
              including a reasonable fee, on such use of the source code for such Axiom Properties
              to ensure that Axiom&apos;s (and its suppliers&apos;) proprietary rights in such
              source code are protected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1.4 Third-Party Materials.</b> As a part of Axiom Properties, you may have access
              to materials that are hosted by another party. You agree that it is impossible for
              Axiom to monitor such materials and that you access these materials at your own risk.

              applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Axiom to pay any fees or making
              Axiom subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers.
              By granting Axiom access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Axiom may
              access, make available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text,
              software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other

              described in the preamble above) and remain in full force and effect while you use
              Axiom Properties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>11.2 Prior Use.</b> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree
              that the Agreement commenced on the earlier to occur of (a) the date you first used
              Axiom Properties or (b) the date you accepted the Agreement and will remain in full
              force and effect while you use any Axiom Properties, unless earlier terminated in
              accordance with the Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>11.3 Termination of Services by Axiom.</b> If you have materially breached any
              provision of the Agreement or if Axiom is required to do so by law (e.g., where the
              provision of the Website, the Software or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful),
              Axiom has the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any
              Services provided to you. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in
              Axiom&apos;s sole discretion and that Axiom shall not be liable to you or any third
              party for any termination of your Account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>11.4 Termination of Services by You.</b> If you want to terminate the Services
              provided by Axiom, you may do so by (a) notifying Axiom at any time and (b) closing
              your Account for all of the Services that you use. Your notice should be sent, in
              writing, to Axiom&apos;s address set forth below.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>11.5 Effect of Termination.</b> Termination of any Service includes removal of
              access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service. Termination of all
              Services also includes deletion of your password and all related information, files
              and Content associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof). Upon
              termination of any Service, your right to use such Service will automatically
              terminate immediately. You understand that any termination of Services may involve
              deletion of any Content associated therewith from our live databases. Axiom will not
              have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for
              deletion of Content. All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should
              survive, shall survive termination of Services, including without limitation,
              ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.

            <li>
              <b>11.6 No Subsequent Registration.</b> If your registration(s) with or ability to
              access Axiom Properties, or any other Axiom community is discontinued by Axiom due to
              your violation of any portion of the Agreement or for conduct otherwise inappropriate
              for the community, then you agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or
              access Axiom Properties or any Axiom community through use of a different member name
              or otherwise, and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to receive a refund
              for fees related to those Axiom Properties to which your access has been terminated.
              In the event that you violate the immediately preceding sentence, Axiom reserves the
              right, in its sole discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth
              herein without any notice or warning to you.

          <p>
            Axiom Properties can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain
            references to Services and Content that are not available in your country. These
            references do not imply that Axiom intends to announce such Services or Content in your
            country. Axiom Properties are controlled and offered by Axiom from its facilities in the
            United States of America. Axiom makes no representations that Axiom Properties are
            appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use Axiom
            Properties from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for
            compliance with local law.

              aspect of your relationship with Axiom, will be resolved by binding arbitration,

              infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks,
              trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration

                The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute
                resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not
                inclusive of attorneys&apos; fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS&apos;s most
                current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
                http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be
                subject to JAMS&apos;s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
                and Procedures, available at
                http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS&apos;s rules are also
                available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not
                available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If
                the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS&apos;s filing,
                administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS,
                Axiom will pay them for you. In addition, Axiom will reimburse all such JAMS&apos;s
                filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than
                $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

              <b>13.3 Authority of Arbitrator.</b> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to
              (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b)
              resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
              formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that
              all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration
              will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Axiom. The arbitration
              proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
              cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive
              of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary
              damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
              under applicable law, the arbitral forum&apos;s rules, and the Agreement (including
              the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement
              of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
              based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
              authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
              have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

              STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You
              and Axiom are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
              arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 13.1
              above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a
              court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or
              jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very
              limited review.

              INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS
              AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
              CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating
              that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection&apos;s limitations
              as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration
              and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of Delaware. All
              other claims shall be arbitrated.
