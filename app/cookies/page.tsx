          <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer when you visit a site.
            Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how our site is being used,
            letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and
            generally improving your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure advertising
            you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.
          </p>
          <h2>Who places cookies on my device?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the site you visit are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by
            parties other than us are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third
            party features or functionality within the site, such as site analytics, advertising and
            social media features. The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your
            computer or device both when it visits the site in question and also when it visits
            certain other sites and/or mobile apps. We do not control how these third parties&apos;
            use your information, which is subject to their own privacy policies. See below for
            details on use of third party cookies and similar technologies with our sites and app.
          </p>
          <h2>How long will cookies stay on my device?</h2>
          <p>
            The length of time a cookie will stay on your device depends on whether it is a
            “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until
            you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have
            finished browsing until they expire or are deleted.
          </p>
          <h2>What other tracking technologies should I know about?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are not the only way to track visitors to a site or app. Companies use tiny
            graphics files with unique identifiers called beacons (and also “pixels” or “clear
            gifs”) to recognize when someone visits its sites. These technologies often depend on
            cookies to function properly, and so disabling cookies may impair their functioning.
          </p>
          <h2>What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies does Axiom use?</h2>
          <p>
            We use cookies and other tracking technologies in the following categories described in
            the table below.
          </p>

                  The subsite, https://cloud.axiom.co (a subsite of axiom.co) uses Mixpanel to help

                  The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons,
                  clear GIFs and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to
                  recognize your web browser, tell us how and when you visit and use our Services,
                  analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services.
                  Cookies are small pieces of data– usually text files – placed on your computer,

                  We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information
                  received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own
                  Cookies on your device(s). Please note that because of our use of Cookies, the

                  Pixels are small amounts of code placed on a web page, in a web-enabled app, or an
                  email. We use pixels, some of which we provide to advertisers to place on their
                  web properties, to learn whether you&apos;ve interacted with specific web or email
                  content — as many services do. This helps us measure and improve our services and
                  personalize your experience, including the ads you see.
